# SDL2_Game_Engine
<i>A first attempt to make a functional and easy to use 2D game engine for C++ with the SDL2 library.</i>

This is my first very own attempt to make a 2D game engine in C++ around the SDL2 library. This engine is heavily inspired by the engine that we created in SoftUni during the Applications Development with C++ course 2021 with lecturer Zhivko Petrov.

# Some details
It is not as sophisticated as the engine developed there but is in my opinion more light and user friendly and I personally cannot wait to make some exciting games with it.

It applies several design patterns such as the fly-weight design pattern. There are funcionalities for rendering images and text, playing sounds and music and timer utilities.

I am sure there are possibilities for improvement in order to make it more robust and safer but as a first attempt I am quite content. I am open to criticism and ideas for improvement.

# Motivation
I started this project on 17.06.2022 and finished it on 28.06.2022. I have been working in my spare time and had to research some topics but I think it is a fair result in the end. I played a tower defense game one day and that inspired me to make my very own TD game. I had a game engine available to me from the course I took in SoftUni but thought that I could give it a try and make my own engine. I really did not expect to have a functioning engine at all, but it happened.

# Finishing words
This code is free to use but please do not claim it as your own as I do not claim others' work as my own.

Thanks for reading and using my creation if you did.
